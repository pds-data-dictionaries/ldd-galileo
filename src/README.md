# LDD Source Directory

This directory should contain one IngestLDD for the LDD being built.
The file name *must* end with the string "IngestLDD" in order for the
auto-generation script to recognize the file.

**The auto-generation script does not currently support retaining or
building multiple versions of an LDD.**
