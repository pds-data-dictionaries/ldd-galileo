"galileo:Observation_Information:2        galileo:observation_id:1                ","Attribute","observation_id","n/a","galileo"," The observation_id element uniquely identifies a scientific observation within a data set. Note: For Galileo the observation_id is in the form NNTIOOOOOOMM#SSSXXXX. Where NN is the orbit number, T is the scan platform target body initial (if applicable), I is the instrument, oooooo is the orbit planning guide objective mnemonic, MM is the sequential OAPEL number for each value of NNTIOOOOOO, # is the multiple observation flag symbol (- or +), SSS is the PA set number and XXXX is the MIPL processing code. The first portion of the observation ID is a 12-character field that begins with two characters for the orbit (e.g., E4, with the letter dropped after orbit C9), followed by one letter for the target body (J - Jupiter, C - Callisto, E - Europa, G - Ganymede, I - Io, N - calibration target, X - space or not applicable), followed by one letter for the prime instrument for the OAPEL (N - NIMS, P - PPR, S - SSI, U - UVS), followed by six characters for the observation name (usually the OAPEL type, but also proper names or abbreviations thereof), followed by a 2-digit observation series number. Thus, the observation IDs for the two PPR global maps of Jupiter in orbit G1 are G1JPGLOBAL01 and G1JPGLOBAL02, while the PPR ride-along with one of the NIMS observations of a brown barge at 42-degree phase angle in orbit E11 is 11JNBRG04203. An exception to the leading portion (prior to -RDR) of the PRODUCT_NAME being identical to the observation ID is that we retain the leading letter for the orbits after C9.
